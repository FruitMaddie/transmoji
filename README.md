# transmoji
 This is a set of emojis I made for my own use on Discord derived from the Twemoji set.

 Each folder is a category of emoji, containing 50 emotes (as that is the cap for Discord servers). I try to keep related emoji together, but if I have to put a bunch together that don't match, then that is how it is.
 
 I included both the edited SVG files (the originals can be found on the Twemoji Github under /assets/svg) and exported 218x218 PNG files, so you can either make higher definition ones, edit it yourself, or just add it to your own servers.
 
 Use this as you will. I really don't care. Also ***trans rights***
